**StyleX Variants** is inspired by [CVA](https://github.com/joe-bell/cva) and [Tailwind Variants](https://github.com/nextui-org/tailwind-variants).

- [**CVA**](https://github.com/joe-bell/cva)

This project has started as an alternative of `cva` when using StyleX.

- [**Tailwind Variants**](https://github.com/nextui-org/tailwind-variants)

Since `Tailwind Variants` has more Features than `cva`. This Project will try to match the functionality
of `Tailwind Variants`.
